# Enhanced Task Conflict Detection System

## Overview

The `TaskConflictService` has been completely rewritten to address two critical issues:

1. **No Ghost Conflicts**: Conflicting tasks must still be present in the actual task list
2. **Original State Validation**: Conflicting tasks must be in their original state (not modified since conflict detection)

## Key Features

### State Validation

-   **Task Presence Check**: Only detects conflicts with tasks that are currently in the task list
-   **State Consistency**: Tracks task state changes and invalidates conflicts when tasks are modified
-   **Smart Caching**: Maintains a cache of task states to detect modifications efficiently

### Conflict Types Detected

-   **Time Overlap**: Tasks that overlap in time
-   **Buffer Time**: Tasks with insufficient buffer time between them

### Severity Levels

-   **Critical**: Tasks starting at the same time
-   **High**: Tasks with significant overlap
-   **Medium**: Tasks with minor overlap
-   **Low**: Insufficient buffer time

## Usage

### Basic Conflict Detection

```swift
let conflicts = conflictService.detectConflicts(for: task, in: allTasks)
```

### Cache Management

```swift
// When a task is modified
conflictService.updateTaskStateCache(for: modifiedTask)

// When a task is deleted
conflictService.removeTaskFromCache(taskId)

// Force refresh for external changes
conflictService.refreshTaskCache(taskId)
```

### Maintenance

```swift
// Periodic cleanup of stale cache entries
conflictService.cleanupCache()

// Debug information
let debugInfo = conflictService.getCacheDebugInfo()
print(debugInfo)
```

## Integration Points

### When to Call `updateTaskStateCache`:

-   Task start time changes
-   Task duration changes
-   Task status changes
-   Task completion state changes

### When to Call `removeTaskFromCache`:

-   Task is deleted
-   Task is cancelled

### Automatic Handling:

-   Filtering out cancelled/deleted tasks
-   Validating task state consistency
-   Preventing conflicts with modified tasks
-   Cache invalidation for changed tasks

## Testing

Use the test method to verify the system is working correctly:

```swift
let (conflicts, validationInfo) = conflictService.testConflictValidation(for: task, in: allTasks)
print(validationInfo)
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Ghost Conflicts**: No more conflicts with deleted or moved tasks
2. **Real-time Validation**: Conflicts are automatically invalidated when tasks change
3. **Performance Optimized**: Smart caching reduces unnecessary conflict recalculations
4. **Developer Friendly**: Clear API and comprehensive documentation
5. **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns and easy to extend

## Migration Notes

The new system is backward compatible. Existing code will continue to work, but for optimal performance and accuracy, consider:

1. Adding cache management calls where tasks are modified
2. Using the new test methods to verify conflict detection accuracy
3. Implementing periodic cache cleanup in your app lifecycle

## Example Implementation

```swift
class TaskManager {
    private let conflictService = TaskConflictService()

    func updateTask(_ task: Task) {
        // Update the task
        task.startTime = newStartTime
        task.durationMinutes = newDuration

        // Update the conflict detection cache
        conflictService.updateTaskStateCache(for: task)

        // Check for new conflicts
        let conflicts = conflictService.detectConflicts(for: task, in: allTasks)
        handleConflicts(conflicts)
    }

    func deleteTask(_ task: Task) {
        // Remove from conflict cache before deletion
        conflictService.removeTaskFromCache(task.id)

        // Delete the task
        // ... deletion logic
    }
}
```
